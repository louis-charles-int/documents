# AllDayLoans & PingFree - Rebuild Plan 2026

**Team:** Pawas & Nitin

**Timeline:** 12 weeks (3 months)

**Last Updated:** 06-01-2026

---

## 🎯 Overview

Rebuild AllDayLoans and PingFree from scratch:
- **AllDayLoans:** Next.js (React + API routes)
- **PingFree:** Laravel API backend + Next.js admin panel
- **Database:** MySQL (latest version)
- **Support:** UK + USA leads in one unified system
- **Multi-project:** AllDayLoans, Yuploans, QuickCashDirect

**Why:** Current PHP/HTML code is outdated. Need USA support and better reporting.

---

## ✅ Decisions Needed

### 1. Tech Stack
- Frontend: React + Next.js + TypeScript
- Backend: Laravel API (PHP) + MySQL
- APIs: JSON-based (replacing old form posts)

**Confirm this stack?**

### 2. Timeline
- 12 weeks (3 months) initial estimate
- Staging after 2 weeks, then iterative updates

**Acceptable timeline?**

### 3. Data Migration
- **Option A:** Start fresh - keep old data in old system
- **Option B:** Migrate all existing data to new system

**Which approach?**

### 4. Multi-Project
One PingFree system handles: AllDayLoans (UK), Yuploans (USA), QuickCashDirect (USA), and future projects.

**Confirm this approach?**
